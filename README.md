# llamacpp-deepseek-v4-flash-0731

Podman-based deployment of `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` (llama.cpp, ROCm 10 gfx1151) running
DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-GGUF (UD-IQ2_XXS) on Strix Halo (Ryzen AI Max+ 395, 32GB UMA).

ROCm 10 is installed **with pip wheels** (no repo.radeon.com RPMs) — see
"ROCm 10 via pip wheels" below.

The GPU target is **hardcoded to `gfx1151`** (AMD Strix Halo / Ryzen AI Max+
395): this repository only builds for that GPU, so it is not a configurable
option in the Makefile, `TAGS`, or the Containerfile.

The Makefile is the single interface for end users. The default deployment is
the **quadlet** method (user systemd, no root):

    make deploy      # install the quadlet units and start the service
    make status      # container state
    make logs        # follow the logs
    make stop        # stop the service

The container definition (name, image, env, devices, IPC, volumes, secret)
lives in the quadlet units and `compose.yaml`. A **podman compose**
deployment is an operator alternative — it is not a make target; see
"podman compose deployment" below.

There are two deployment methods; both define the identical container (name,
image, port 8000, devices, IPC, volumes, env) and both target the same
**production slot** — the container `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` on :8000. Run exactly one
at a time:

| Method | File(s) | Start |
|---|---|---|
| quadlet (systemd --user, **default**) | `config/containers/systemd/deepseek-v4-flash-0731/*.container`, `*.build` | `make deploy` (installs the units, no root needed) |
| podman compose (operator alternative) | `compose.yaml` | `podman compose up -d` (manual — see "podman compose deployment" below) |

Both are kept in lockstep with `TAGS` by `make sync` (maintainer section of
the Makefile), so their image/model references never drift.

> The quadlet units are installed in the user namespace but **not
> enabled** on this machine; `make deploy` (plain `podman run`) is the
> default method.

> **Safety / production slot.** The deploy targets refuse to take over a
> slot owned by another method (an active quadlet unit, or a
> compose-managed container), so a stray `make deploy` — human or AI
> agent — cannot take production down; taking the slot is always a
> deliberate two-step act (e.g. `podman compose down && make deploy`).
> The quadlet config is **static** (pinned tag, never `:latest` — enforced
> by `make verify`), and the build/test flow (`make build`,
> `make deploy-test`, `make bench`, `make sync`) never touches the running
> production container. Promoting a new version is explicit:
> `make sync` (advance the pin) + the owning method's deploy target.

## The Makefile

The Makefile is the single interface. The **end-user** part at the top deploys
the service via quadlet (the only thing you usually change is
`CONTAINER_NAME`), and the **maintainer** part at the bottom builds and updates
the image. The container definition itself lives in the quadlet units and
`compose.yaml`.

**End-user targets** (all you need to run the container):

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `make deploy` | install the quadlet units and start the service (user systemd, no root) |
| `make status` / `make logs` / `make stop` | container lifecycle |

**Maintainer targets** (build & update the image). The image tag is
**computed, never hand-typed**. `TAGS` (repo root) is the single source of
truth for the build inputs; the Makefile derives:

    IMAGE_TAG = <LLAMA_BUILD>-rocm-<ROCM_VERSION>    e.g. v0.4.1-rocm-10.0.0
    IMAGE     = localhost/deepseek-v4-flash-0731:v0.4.1-rocm-10.0.0    (+ a `latest` alias)

`make sync` rewrites the image reference — and the quadlet `BuildArg=` lines
plus the `LLAMA_ARG_HF_REPO` model ref — in all file-based deployment
methods, so the equivalent files can never drift on the image reference;
`make verify` fails on drift.

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `make show` | active tag + every image reference in the repo |
| `make verify` | fail unless every file-based method references exactly the active tag |
| `make new-build TAG=<v-or-b-tag>` | point `TAGS` at a llama.cpp release (`vX.Y.Z`) or nightly (`bXXXXX`) tag (optional `ROCM=`, `FEDORA=`) |
| `make update` | zero-input update: discover the latest llama.cpp release tag (`vX.Y.Z`) + newest ROCm with a `gfx1151` wheel, update `TAGS`, build, sync, deploy, **label in git** (commit + tag) |
| `make update-dry` | preview `make update` (discover + diff + plan; nothing is changed) |
| `make build` | `podman build` with `TAG=<LLAMA_BUILD>` (the llama.cpp release/nightly tag) pinned; tags `IMAGE` + `latest` |
| `make tag FROM=<old-tag>` | retag an existing local image to the active tag (no rebuild) |
| `make sync` | rewrite image refs / build args / model ref in all file-based methods |
| `make deploy-test` / `make down-test` / `make bench` | :8001 validation container (plain `podman run`, active TAGS image) + A/B throughput; never touches the production container (identity collisions are refused) |

Deploying a new tag:

    make new-build TAG=<v-or-b-tag>           # 1. point TAGS at the tag
    make build                                  # 2. build it — or `make tag FROM=<old-tag>` to reuse an existing image
    make deploy                                 # 3. recreate the container on the new tag

**Automatic update — `make update` takes no arguments.** It discovers the
latest llama.cpp (the newest official release tag, `vX.Y.Z`, on
`ggml-org/llama.cpp` via `git ls-remote` — the same tags shown as releases
on github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases; a nightly `bXXXXX` can be pinned
instead with `make new-build`) and
the newest ROCm that ships a linux wheel for `gfx1151` on AMD's pip
index (`stable.repo.amd.com/rocm/whl-next/`) — newer ROCm releases are
skipped until they add a wheel for this GPU (only `10.0.0` has `gfx1151`).
If either is newer than `TAGS`, it rewrites `TAGS`, runs
`make build && make sync && make deploy`, waits for `/health`, then commits
`TAGS` + the synced deploy files and adds an **annotated git tag named
like the image tag** (e.g. `b10944-rocm-10.0.0`) — every deployed build
is labeled in git history. If a git remote is added, commit + tag are
pushed. Idempotent: exits 0 and does nothing when up to date (cron-safe).
`make update-dry` shows the discovery + diff without changing anything;
`scripts/update.py --no-deploy` builds + labels without touching the
running container.

- `LLAMA_BUILD` is the llama.cpp git tag (release `vX.Y.Z` or nightly
  `bXXXXX`) and `LLAMA_COMMIT` is the commit that tag resolves to, so the
  image tag always describes the exact binary inside.
- The Containerfile's default `TAG` and the quadlet `BuildArg=TAG=` are
  pinned to the same tag; `make sync` keeps the quadlet lines current.
- `make deploy-quadlet` runs in the **user namespace** (no root): it
  installs the units into `~/.config/containers/systemd/deepseek-v4-flash-0731/`,
  then starts `deepseek-v4-flash-0731-build.service` and `deepseek-v4-flash-0731.service` via
  `systemctl --user` (linger is enabled for this user, so the service
  survives logout).

## podman compose deployment

`podman compose` is the operator alternative to `make deploy` (quadlet). It is
**not** a make target — run the compose CLI directly against
`compose.yaml`:

    podman compose up -d                 # start (recreates if changed, like --replace)
    podman compose down                  # stop & remove
    podman compose logs -f deepseek-v4-flash-0731  # follow the logs
    podman compose ps                    # status

**Overrides.** The name, image and published port default to the `TAGS`
lockstep values, but honor the same three environment-variable overrides:

    CONTAINER_NAME=my-server IMAGE=your/image:tag PORT=9000 podman compose up -d

**IPC patch (mandatory).** `podman-compose` v1.6.0 parses `ipc:` but never
emits `--ipc` to the `podman run` argv, so the local install is patched (see
§1, "The fix: IPC namespace"). Re-run `scripts/fedora-setup.sh` after any
podman-compose reinstall/update, or the model fails to load.

**Production slot.** Compose and quadlet share the same slot (container
`deepseek-v4-flash-0731` on :8000). `make deploy` refuses to start while a compose
container is present. Taking the slot over deliberately is a two-step act:

    systemctl --user disable --now deepseek-v4-flash-0731.service && podman compose up -d

## ROCm 10 via pip wheels

The image no longer uses the `repo.radeon.com` RPM repository. ROCm
`10.0.0` is installed from AMD's pip-wheel index, per AMD's pip install
docs (https://rocm.docs.amd.com, "Install ROCm wheel packages"), which for
this hardware (Ryzen AI Max / `gfx1151`) and Python 3.14 are:

```
python -m pip install --index-url https://stable.repo.amd.com/rocm/whl-next/ \
    "rocm[libraries,device-gfx1151]==10.0.0"
```

The Containerfile adds the `devel` extra on top (`rocm[libraries,devel,device-gfx1151]`)
because `llama.cpp` is compiled from source in the image: `devel` carries the
HIP compiler, CMake configs, headers and static libraries. The wheels unpack
a classic `/opt/rocm`-style tree under the venv:

| Wheel payload | Contents |
|---|---|
| `_rocm_sdk_core` | runtime libraries (HIP, HSA, comgr, SMI, ...) + `amdgpu.ids` |
| `_rocm_sdk_libraries` | rocBLAS / hipBLAS / hipBLASLt + `gfx1151` prebuilt kernels |
| `_rocm_sdk_devel` | SDK root: `hipcc`, clang/LLVM, CMake configs, headers, static libs |

Build stage (fedora:44): `dnf` installs only the host build tools
(`gcc g++ cmake ninja-build ...`, `python3` 3.14 + `python3-pip`); the venv
at `/opt/rocm-venv` holds the ROCm wheels; `rocm-sdk path --root` pins the
(de-lazily-expanded) SDK root, and `llama.cpp` is configured with the same
CMake flags as the old RPM build — `CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1151`,
`GGML_HIP=1`, `GGML_RPC=1`, `LLAMA_HIP_UMA=1` — pointed at the wheel's SDK
root via `HIP_PATH`/`ROCM_PATH`/`HIP_CLANG_PATH`/`HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH`.
The wheel's `hipcc` compiles the HIP side; the host `gcc` compiles the
C/C++ side (same compiler split as the RPM build).

Runtime stage (fedora-minimal): only a **slim consolidated tree** is copied
to `/opt/rocm-10.0.0/lib` — the core runtime libs (HIP, HSA, comgr, SMI,
bundled sysdeps), the BLAS stack (rocBLAS / hipBLAS / hipBLASLt + their
`gfx1151` prebuilt kernels), and `amdgpu.ids` (also at
`/usr/share/libdrm/`). ROCm 10's rocBLAS additionally pulls its
`rocsolver` / `origami` / `rocroller` backends, which link against the
wheel's bundled LLVM/Clang runtime (`libLLVM.so.23.0git`,
`libclang-cpp.so.23.0git`) — those two runtime libs are included; the rest
of the LLVM toolchain (compiler, MLIR, clang tools) is not. No venv, no
compiler, no RPM repos. Final image: **1.41 GB** (vs 2.67 GB for the old
RPM-based `rocm-7.2.4` image). `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` points at
`/opt/rocm-10.0.0/lib`; `GGML_HIP_UMA=1` and `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` stay
as before.

### ROCm 10.0.0 vs 7.2.4 — A/B (same llama.cpp b10902)

`scripts/bench.py` A/B: production server (`b10902-rocm-7.2.4`, :8000)
vs test container (`b10902-rocm-10.0.0`, :8001), identical llama.cpp
build (`build 10902`), DeepSeek-V4-Flash IQ2_XXS with `draft-mtp` speculative
decoding, quiet iGPU, 3 runs × 128 tokens, alternating to equalize GPU
contention:

| | ROCm 7.2.4 | ROCm 10.0.0 |
|---|---|---|
| eval t/s (mean) | 28.30 | 25.31 |
| eval t/s (min) | 28.23 | 23.82 |
| prompt t/s (mean) | ~26.3 | ~21.2 |

**ROCm 10.0.0 is ≈10% slower on token generation** for this class of model on
this iGPU (the absolute t/s figures above are from the reference model in that
A/B run); prompt processing is comparable. The 10-wheel image is kept as the
maintainable single-pip-source build — flip production with
`make deploy` if/when the regression is acceptable or gone in a later ROCm.

## 1. The fix: IPC namespace (mandatory)

The model cannot load in a container with the *default* (private) IPC
namespace, even with `shm_size` bumped to 64GB:

```
model buffer is using system RAM (no shared memory detected) ...
LLAMA_FAILED_TO_ALLOCATE / memory in use
```

Only `--ipc=host` (the host's ~63GB /dev/shm namespace) works. This is why
a plain `podman run --ipc=host` works and the unpatched compose stack
originally failed.

- `compose.yaml` → `ipc: host`
- **`podman-compose` v1.6.0 has a bug: it parses `ipc:` but never emits
  `--ipc` to the `podman run` argv.** The local install is patched
  (2 lines after the `shm_size` handler). `scripts/fedora-setup.sh` §3.7
  re-applies the patch idempotently and verifies the running container
  reports `IpcMode=host`.

> **Re-run `scripts/fedora-setup.sh` after any podman-compose
> reinstall/update** — the patch is lost otherwise, and this exact failure
> returns.

## 2. Runtime configuration

The runtime is tuned for Strix Halo (Ryzen AI Max+ 395, 32 GB UMA, `gfx1151`).
The final configuration is the `environment:` block in `compose.yaml`
(mirrored in the quadlet unit); `make verify` keeps the file-based methods in
lockstep.

```yaml
environment:
  LLAMA_ARG_THREADS: "8"
  LLAMA_ARG_LOAD_MODE: "auto"
  LLAMA_ARG_CTX_SIZE: "262144"
  LLAMA_ARG_FLASH_ATTN: "on"
  LLAMA_ARG_N_PARALLEL: "1"
  LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_TYPE: "draft-mtp"
  LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_TYPE_K: "q8_0"
  LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_TYPE_V: "q8_0"
```

Rationale for the non-obvious knobs:

- `ipc: host` is the only decisive parameter (without it, t/s = 0 — the
  model cannot load); see §1.
- `LLAMA_ARG_N_GPU_LAYERS=99` offloads all layers to the iGPU. The `IQ2_XXS`
  quant keeps the weights compact enough to fit in 32 GB UMA alongside the KV
  cache at 256K context.
- The explicit `q8_0` KV cache halves KV memory versus the default `f16`.
- `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_TYPE=draft-mtp` enables self-speculative decoding via the
  model's built-in MTP (multi-token-prediction) head. This flag is
  **model-dependent** — it applies only if the DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 GGUF
  ships an MTP head; drop it if the model file has no MTP tensors.

> **Benchmarks are model-specific.** Throughput differs per model, so figures
> from the model this configuration was inherited from do not carry over.
> Re-run `make bench` to measure DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 on this iGPU before
> comparing against any target.

## 3. Reasoning / thinking mode

DeepSeek-V4-Flash is a **reasoning** model. With the current configuration,
reasoning is always on — including when tools are enabled — and assistant
reasoning traces are kept in conversation history. The relevant server-level
flags set in the deploy env vars:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING=on` | llama.cpp emits reasoning as a separate `reasoning` field in chat responses (reasoning is not disabled when tools are active) |
| `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING_EFFORT=medium` | passes a `reasoning_effort` hint to the model's chat template |
| `LLAMA_ARG_JINJA=on` | use the GGUF's built-in Jinja chat template |

`reasoning_effort` is a prompt-level hint (**not a token budget**); the
accepted level names and the default are defined by the model's own chat
template, so verify them against the DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 GGUF. It is a
server-level setting (this build has no per-request field in its OpenAPI), so
it is only changeable via the env vars — all deploy files must stay in sync
(`make sync` / `make verify`).

## 4. Caveats

- **Shared GPU contention:** while *any* other GPU workload is mid-generation,
  throughput on this iGPU drops sharply. Measure only during quiet windows;
  relative ranking between configs is stable.
- **podman-compose patch durability:** see §1 — re-run
  `scripts/fedora-setup.sh` after any package reinstall/update.
- **Deployment methods are aligned:** the Makefile (default method) and all
  file-based methods (compose, quadlet) carry the same runtime config and the
  same `LLAMA_ARG_*` env vars — the runtime values from §2 plus the Web UI /
  agent feature flags, the reasoning flags from §3, and `SPEC_TYPE=draft-mtp`
  (MTP speculative decoding, model-dependent). `MODELS_DIR` is a no-op for
  current llama-server builds (`-hf` resolution uses the HF cache dir, not
  `--models-dir`).
- **Feature flags:** `LLAMA_ARG_AGENT=on` (which implies
  `LLAMA_ARG_TOOLS=all` and the MCP proxy) is experimental per llama.cpp —
  "do not enable in untrusted environments". The server also listens on
  `0.0.0.0:8000` without an API key; keep it on trusted networks only.
- **Live stack:** deploy via `make deploy` (quadlet) or `podman compose up -d`;
  both run the identical aligned env (UI / agent / tools feature flags plus
  `REASONING_EFFORT=medium` for reasoning mode, §3).
